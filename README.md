# Grammar Scoring Engine for Voice Samples

## Project Description
The Grammar Scoring Engine for Voice Samples is an innovative tool that combines state-of-the-art speech-to-text transcription, grammar checking, and advanced readability analysis to provide a comprehensive evaluation of spoken content. This project leverages OpenAI’s Whisper model for audio transcription and LanguageTool for grammar and style analysis to generate detailed reports with actionable feedback.

## Features
- **Audio Transcription:** Converts voice samples to text using the Whisper model.
- **Grammar and Style Analysis:** Detects and classifies grammar errors, typos, punctuation, and style issues.
- **Advanced Readability Metrics:** Computes readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade, and Gunning Fog Index) along with suggestions for improvement.
- **Inline Error Correction:** Highlights errors in the transcript, allowing users to click and view suggestions.
- **Comparison Mode:** Provides side-by-side comparison of the original transcript and the corrected version.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates a detailed report summarizing overall score, error breakdown, style analysis, and additional recommendations.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built using Tkinter, the interface supports both file upload and live audio recording.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `tkinter`
  - `whisper`
  - `language_tool_python`
  - `sounddevice`
  - `soundfile`
  - `numpy`
  - `textstat`
- Ensure your system has access to a microphone for recording audio.

## How to Install and Run
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grammar-scoring-engine.git
   cd grammar-scoring-engine
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install the Required Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Alternatively, manually install each library if a requirements file is not available.*
4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will launch the GUI where you can choose to record or upload audio files for analysis.

## How to Use the Project
1. **Transcription and Analysis:**
   - Click **"Select & Process Audio File"** to load an existing audio file.
   - Use **"Start Recording"** to begin capturing audio and **"Stop Recording"** to finish.
2. **Error Correction:**
   - Use **"Inline Correction"** to highlight errors in the transcript. Click any highlighted error to view suggestions.
   - Use **"Full Correction"** to automatically correct the entire transcript.
   - Use **"Comparison Mode"** to view the original transcript alongside the corrected version.
3. **Reviewing Results:**
   - The GUI displays the transcribed text, grammar score, detailed error feedback, style analysis, and a comprehensive report.
